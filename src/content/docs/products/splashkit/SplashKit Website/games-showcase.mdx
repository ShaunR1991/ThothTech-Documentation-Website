## Games Showcase Template

The [Games Showcase Template](./games-showcase-template) is to be used when adding a game to the Games Showcase on the SplashKit.io website. This will be included in the /src/content/docs/games folder of the SplashKit.io folder. 

#### Frontmatter

```frontmatter
---
title: 
description: 
download-link: ""
featured: true
sidebar:
  hidden: false
---
```

- **title**: Game Title
- **description**: Short description of game here. Keep this short as it will generate the thumbnail in the index page.
- **download-link**: The link to the download-directory.github.io tool to download the github repository that holds the game. Simply copy the link to the game parent game folder and add it to the end of `https://download-directory.github.io?url=`. The download-link needs to be encapsulated in double quotes`""`.
- **featured**: This flag is to determine if the game is shown on the Games Index page. The Games Index page will automatically populate based on the frontmatter.
- **sidebar**: Set the hidden flag to determine if the game will show up on the sidebar.

#### Game Gif

This will be automatically generated when the gif file is placed into the /public/gifs/games-showcase folder with the naming convention game-title-showcase.gif. Do not adjust this.

#### Description

Add a description of the game.

#### Installation

Include installation instructions that are language specific.

:::tip
An example may look like this:

```markdown
1. Download the game files.
2. Navigate to the folder.
3. Execute `dotnet run` through the MSYS2 terminal.
```
:::

The Download button is automatically derived from the frontmatter - do not alter this 
```html
<div class="centered-button-container">
  <button
    class="custom-button"
    onclick={`window.open('${frontmatter['download-link']}', '_blank')`}>
    Download
  </button>
</div>
```

#### Gameplay

Briefly describe the gameplay of the game. Include any controls.

| Move Left    | A        |
| Move Right   | D        |
| Shoot        | Space    |
```

#### Developers

Include the link to the github(s) of the developer(s).

```markdown
[thoth-tech](https://github.com/thoth-tech) 
```

Include the date that the game was last updated.

```markdown

```

A Back to Games Index button will be automatically generated - do not alter this code.

```html
<div class="centered-button-container">
  <button
    class="custom-button"
    onclick="location.href='/games'">
    Back to Games Index
  </button>
</div>
```

## Adding Games to the Home Page Swiper

To add a game to the front page swiper, you will need to edit the games-config.json folder found in the src/components/react/GameCardSwiper folder. 

To add a game card to the swiper, include another entry into the json file in the following format:

```json
   {
        "name": "Game Name",
        "description": "Game Description",
        "link": "game-name",
        "featured": true
    },
```

- **title**: Game Title - this is what the Game Swiper will call your game.
- **description**: Short description of game here. Keep this short as it will generate the thumbnail in the index page.
- **link**: This will be the lower case version of the game name, with all spaces replaced with `-`. This will allow all of the relevant files within the repo to link the game to the different features.
- **featured**: This flag is to determine if the game is shown on the Swiper or not.
