## Project 1: OnTrack

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

OnTrack, also known as Doubtfire, is an innovative Learning Management System (LMS) designed
specifically for skill-based course delivery. This platform enhances the connection between tutors
and students, with a primary focus on Deakin University and other global educational institutions.
OnTrack aims to elevate the educational experience by offering a structured, efficient, and
interactive learning environment. The system is crafted to improve student engagement, boost
learning outcomes, and streamline the teaching and learning process, benefiting both students and
educators.

### Aims for Trimester

Trimester Aims for OnTrack Development:

- **Bug Fixes and Implement Urgent Enhancements**: This trimester will focus on addressing and
  documenting bugs reported by students, particularly those affecting the student calendar and
  notifications system. Urgent enhancements will also be implemented, such as adding support for ZIP
  file uploads, enabling students to view the history of target grade changes, saving unsent draft
  comments locally for each task, adjusting the automatic extension "resubmit" feature to provide a
  one-week extension from the feedback date, and extending the group lock feature to allow students
  to unlock and lock groups as needed.

- **Initiate Frontend Migration**: A significant effort will be dedicated to completing the
  migration of the frontend module from Angular.js and Coffeescript to Angular 17 and Typescript.
  Once the current migration backlogs are resolved, the team will assess and determine which
  additional modules will be prioritised for migration, ensuring that the transition to modern
  technologies is smoothly executed.

- **Revamp Feature Implementations**: The trimester will also involve a thorough examination and
  update of existing features to align with OnTrack’s evolving software. This includes abstracting
  the current authentication system into its own dedicated module and integrating the JPLag software
  plagiarism detection system with Docker Compose, replacing the existing MOSS system to enhance
  plagiarism detection capabilities.

- **Complete the Documentation Website**: Comprehensive documentation of OnTrack’s evolving features
  will be completed to assist new developers. This effort includes documenting all missing API
  endpoints, improving the documentation for existing endpoints where necessary, and creating a
  detailed map of areas requiring documentation. This documentation will ensure that new developers
  can quickly understand and contribute to the project.

- **Continue CourseFlow development**: Development will progress on the CourseFlow API entities by
  updating them with appropriate authentication and creating a functional frontend for student
  interaction. Testing will be conducted on both backend and frontend components to showcase
  progress and support ongoing development, with the goal of delivering a usable slice of the
  component.

- **Add New Features**: Several new features will be implemented to enhance OnTrack’s functionality.
  These include tools for staff to manage student extensions, the capability to create, edit, and
  disable multiple organisations on a single server, integration with Panopto for video uploads and
  embeds, and the implementation of CourseFlow. Additionally, a dedicated page will be developed to
  allow tutors to track the time spent providing feedback for each student.

- **Quality of Life Improvements**: Critically examine and implement quality of life improvements to
  enhance the user experience. This includes adding functionalities such as allowing unit chairs to
  set target dates that affect task due dates and creating visualisations to help students track
  their selected target grades, estimated progress, and feedback status.

SplashKit is a versatile and user-friendly programming framework designed to introduce students to
programming through the engaging process of 2D game development. Primarily coded in C++, SplashKit
also supports a variety of other languages, including C#, Python, Pascal, and, more recently,
JavaScript.

The SplashKit Software Development Kit (SDK) offers seamless integration with popular development
environments, enabling the easy incorporation of robust graphics and game development capabilities
into projects. With a single codebase, developers can create games and applications that run across
multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. The SplashKit SDK is renowned for its
intuitive interface and a comprehensive set of features that streamline the game development
process.

Additionally, SplashKit provides an extensive array of detailed documentation and tutorials,
designed to help students get started quickly and maximise their use of the SDK. This wealth of
resources empowers learners to progress at their own pace and fully explore the capabilities of
SplashKit, making it an invaluable tool for both beginners and more advanced users.

### Projects

**Arcade Machines**:

The university has acquired four arcade machines equipped with Raspberry Pi 3B+ units, designed to
showcase games developed with SplashKit. The short-term goal is to prepare these platforms for
students to display their SplashKit creations. The medium-term goal is to streamline the process for
first-year students to easily upload and test their games.

**Game Development**:

The Game Development team is dedicated to creating and enhancing games that run on the arcade
machines. Their mission is to demonstrate SplashKit’s capabilities and inspire students by
showcasing what can be achieved with the framework.

**SplashKit Website**:

Powered by the Starlight framework, the revamped SplashKit website aims to offer an enriched and
user-friendly experience for developers and learners. It will host existing tutorials and guides,
providing a central hub for exploring and learning about SplashKit.

**SplashKit Tutorials**:

The SplashKit Website will feature tutorials aimed at helping students learn and explore SplashKit’s
functionality. The focus is on developing smaller, high-quality tutorials across C++, C#, and
Python, rather than extensive series.

**SplashKit Expansion**:

The Expansion team is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the SplashKit core. This includes
bug fixes, feature improvements, and refining installation and usage workflows through package
creation and addressing installation issues.

**SplashKit Online**:

SplashKit Online is developing a web-based IDE that allows students to write and run code directly
in their browsers. Initially launched as a prototype in 2023, the 2024 goal is to mature this tool
into a comprehensive product, including C# support and an embeddable version for the SplashKit
website.

### Aims for Trimester

Trimester Aims for SplashKit Development:

- **Refine and Complete SplashKit Online**: Finalise the development and polish of SplashKit Online
  to enhance its functionality and user experience. This includes embedding a "lite" version into
  the SplashKit website, focusing on seamless integration, improving interface design, and
  optimising performance for code snippets and interactive features. Migrate the current version to
  the Thoth Tech repository for centralised management.

- **Establish and Manage Software Packages**: Initiate the development of a comprehensive package
  management system for SplashKit libraries. This includes organising and automating the creation of
  software packages, ensuring their proper integration and usage across different platforms. Provide
  thorough documentation and sample projects to support users in integrating and utilising the
  packages effectively.

  the latest features of SplashKit. Complete pending tutorials, including advanced topics like
  creating a 2D Metroidvania game and networking basics. Develop new tutorials for Raspberry Pi GPIO
  functionalities and networking principles. Ensure all tutorials are clear, interactive, and
  supported by updated guides.

- **Advance Arcade Game Automation**: Develop a foundational structure for arcade game automation.
  Enhance the EmulationStation menu to support new modes (Kiosk and Normal) and game download
  scripts. Create a local test mode for new game builds and implement a voting system to improve the
  star ranking process. Address C# compatibility issues and formalise the game upload process for
  student contributions.

- **Revamp SplashKit Website**: Establish a core onboarding hub on the SplashKit website, including
  onboarding guides, tutorial templates, and links to essential resources. Improve the API reference
  with additional usage examples, live demos, and a global language switcher. Fix broken parts of
  ported tutorials and import completed ones. Design and launch a showcase page to feature games
  developed with SplashKit, enhancing the website's visual appeal and user engagement.

- **Standardise Game Development Approach**: Introduce standardised implementation patterns for game
  development, focusing on decoupling data and functionality. Develop a "10-minute game" to
  implement core mechanics early in the trimester, allowing time for visual enhancements and
  additional features. Create documentation on discrete game systems and refine the implementation
  patterns based on feedback.
